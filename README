Blowfish Encryption Project

This repository contains the implementation of the Blowfish encryption algorithm along with various test files for evaluating its performance based on different cryptographic properties.

Files and Descriptions

blowfish.c: Main implementation of the Blowfish encryption algorithm.
blowfish.h: Header file containing function prototypes and definitions.
blowfish.o: Compiled object file for Blowfish.
blowfish_avalanche.c: Evaluates the Avalanche effect in Blowfish.
blowfish_avalanche.exe: Executable for Avalanche effect testing.
blowfish_correlation.c: Tests correlation properties of encrypted data.
blowfish_correlation.exe: Executable for correlation testing.
blowfish_entropy.c: Measures entropy of encrypted data.
blowfish_entropy.exe: Executable for entropy testing.
blowfish_rounds.c: Analyzes encryption strength based on different round configurations.
blowfish_rounds.exe: Executable for round testing.
blowfish_test.c: Test file for Blowfish encryption, includes Initialization Vector (IV) for CBC mode.
blowfish_test.exe: Executable for Blowfish encryption testing.

Running the Program:
gcc -c blowfish.c
gcc -c blowfish_test.c
gcc -o blowfish_test blowfish_test.c blowfish.c -I.
./blowfish_test

Similarly for rest of the Cryptographic Tests
Example: gcc -o blowfish_correlation blowfish.c blowfish_correlation.c
./blowfish_correlation

gcc -o blowfish_entropy blowfish_entropy.c -lm
./blowfish_entropy
